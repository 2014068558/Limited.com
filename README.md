# Limited.com

This website will limit the usage of a computer from accessing websites that are blocked by the system. For example: in UST, Facebook is blocked from accessing using Veritas wifi. Some students need to get details which can only be found in facebook like posts from UST central student council page, or they need to communicate with their groupmates through messenger. This website allows students to access these blocked websites but with certain amount of time only (20 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc..) It can also be used by parents to limit their children's usage of the internet by giving them a limit of time to surf the internet or any social medias, other sites not included in the LIMITED must first be authorized by the parents before they can access that particular website.
